A school project UniChat

Coming soon!


## usage so far

Dev the frontend:
Install required node modules

```
cd client/
npm install
gulp dev
```

`gulp dev` makes a static server and run livereload. Use chrome livereload
extension to get it working.

To see that the dev environment is running correctly, navigate with your browser to `localhost:8000`

For production
```
gulp
```
Which minifies the css and js files.

Frontend uses React.js at the moment for the rendering.
